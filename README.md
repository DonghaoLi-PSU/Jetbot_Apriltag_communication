# Jetbot_Apriltag_communication
This allows two jetbots to communicate location by Aprital in real-time. It is designed for PSU ME435.  
Thanks to Dr. **Siu Ling Leung**'s help and hope you enjoy the courses.  

**Introduction:**  
apriltag.py should be implemented in the camera-bot while Realtime_AprilTag.ipynb should be implemented on the jetbot which requests real-time location.
